### 🚀 Features

1. **Perfect integration of literature and AI**: Carefully crafted modern Chinese literary style immerses you into the game.

3. **Diverse life paths**: From academics to career, from love to family, every choice impacts your life journey. 

4. **Randomness and playability**: GPT-4's advanced data analysis generates abundant life events and attributes on the fly. Each gameplay is a brand new experience.

### 📥 Installation and Setup

To run the game, open GPT-4's [Advanced Data Analysis (formerly Code Interpreter)](https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4-code-interpreter) and copy-paste the full content of [LifeReloaded.txt](https://github.com/sharkqwy/LifeReloaded/blob/main/LifeReloaded.txt) into the chatbox. 

#### Prerequisites

⚠️ **You must enable GPT-4's Advanced Data Analysis (formerly Code Interpreter). Currently, it's only available to ChatGPT Plus users.**

#### Get Updates

🔗 This project gets updated periodically. Please visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sharkqwy/LifeReloaded).

### 🎮 Game Preview

Here are some screenshots of the game. Your experience may vary due to the randomness of large language models. 

#### Initialization 

At the beginning of each game, the system randomly generates and assigns the player's gender, birthplace, initial stats, family background, etc.

Each character also gets a unique poem.

#### Events

The player encounters different events at different life stages and can react to them.

All events and options are generated on the fly by GPT4 Code Interpreter. 

Every choice will change the character's life path or stats, so choose wisely!
